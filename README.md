This repository contains a Python code example that highlights a common error when calculating the average of a list of numbers.  The original code fails when given an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values. The solution demonstrates how to improve the code's robustness by adding explicit checks for empty lists and using exception handling to deal with non-numeric elements.
